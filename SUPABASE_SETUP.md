# Supabase Setup Guide for SR Kasmoni

This guide will walk you through setting up Supabase as your database for the SR Kasmoni application.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click "Start your project" and sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Choose your organization
5. Fill in project details:
   - **Name**: `srkasmoni` (or your preferred name)
   - **Database Password**: Create a strong password (save this!)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users
6. Click "Create new project"
7. Wait for the project to be ready (usually 2-3 minutes)

### 2. Get Your Project Credentials

1. In your project dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://your-project.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public** key (starts with `eyJ...`)

### 3. Configure Your Application

#### Option A: Environment Variables (Recommended)

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials

#### Option B: Update Config File

1. Open `src/config/supabase-config.ts`
2. Replace the placeholder values:
```typescript
export const SUPABASE_CONFIG = {
  URL: 'https://your-project.supabase.co',
  ANON_KEY: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...'
}
```

### 4. Set Up Your Database

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the entire contents of `database-schema.sql`
3. Paste it into the SQL Editor
4. Click "Run" to execute the schema

This will create:
- `members` table with all necessary fields
- `groups` table for organizing members
- Sample data to get you started
- Proper indexes for performance
- Row Level Security policies

### 5. Test Your Setup

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the Members page
3. You should see the sample members loaded from Supabase
4. Try adding, editing, or deleting a member

- Verify your anon key is correct
- Check table permissions in Supabase

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding this to your browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('supabase.debug', 'true')
```

## üîÑ Database Migrations

When you need to update your database schema:

1. Make changes in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Test thoroughly
3. Document changes in `database-schema.sql`
4. Consider using Supabase migrations for production

## üìä Monitoring

### Supabase Dashboard
- Monitor database performance
- View query logs
- Check storage usage
- Monitor API usage

### Application Logs
- Check browser console for errors
- Monitor network requests
- Use React DevTools for state debugging

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Vercel Deployment
1. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Deploy your application
3. Verify Supabase connection works

### Environment Variables in Production
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Use Vercel's environment variable system
- Keep your anon key public (it's designed to be public)

## Database Schema

### Banks Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE banks (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

  address TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Key Features
- **Unique Constraints**: Both name and short_name are unique to prevent duplicates
- **Automatic Timestamps**: created_at and updated_at are automatically managed
- **Row Level Security**: Enabled for proper access control
- **Indexes**: Optimized for name and short_name searches

## Technical Implementation

### Files Added/Modified
- `src/types/bank.ts` - Bank type definitions
- `src/services/bankService.ts` - Bank CRUD operations
- `src/components/BankModal.tsx` - Add/Edit bank modal
- `src/components/BankModal.css` - Modal styling
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx` - Added banks tab and functionality
- `src/pages/Settings.css` - Added banks section styling
- `database-migration-banks.sql` - Database migration script

### Key Components

#### BankModal Component
- **Form Validation**: Ensures all required fields are filled
- **Error Handling**: Displays validation errors clearly
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Mode Support**: Handles both create and edit modes

#### BankService
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete banks
- **Data Transformation**: Converts between database and application formats
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Search Functionality**: Find banks by name or short name

### State Management
- **Banks List**: Stores all banks for display
- **Loading States**: Manages async operations
- **Error Handling**: Tracks and displays errors
- **Modal States**: Controls modal visibility and mode

## Data Validation

### Required Fields
- **Bank Name**: Must not be empty
- **Short Name**: Must not be empty and limited to 50 characters
- **Bank Address**: Must not be empty

### Business Rules
- **Unique Names**: Bank names must be unique across the system
- **Unique Short Names**: Short names must be unique across the system
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents duplicate entries

## Integration Points

### Member Registration
- Banks list is used in member registration forms
- Members can select from available banks when entering bank details
- Bank information is stored with member records

### Member Updates
- Banks list is available when members update their information
- Changes to bank details are reflected in member records

### Future Enhancements
- **Bank Branch Management**: Add support for multiple branches per bank
- **Bank Contact Information**: Include phone numbers and email addresses
- **Bank Logo Support**: Add visual identification for banks
- **Bank Status Management**: Track active/inactive bank status

## Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Enabled on the banks table
- Policies allow public read/write access (configurable)
- Can be restricted based on user roles if needed

### Data Validation
- Client-side validation prevents invalid data submission
- Server-side validation ensures data integrity
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate entries

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes
- Index on `name` field for fast name-based searches
- Index on `short_name` field for fast short name lookups
- Optimized queries for listing and searching banks

### Caching Strategy
- Banks list is loaded when the tab is accessed
- Data is refreshed after each CRUD operation
- Minimal API calls for optimal performance

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios
- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling of connection issues
- **Validation Errors**: Clear display of form validation issues
- **Duplicate Entries**: Informative error messages for unique constraint violations
- **Server Errors**: User-friendly error messages for system issues

### User Experience
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error information
- **Success Feedback**: Confirmation of successful operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: System remains functional even with errors

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests
- Bank service methods
- Form validation logic
- Modal component behavior

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end bank management workflows
- Database operations
- API interactions

### User Acceptance Tests

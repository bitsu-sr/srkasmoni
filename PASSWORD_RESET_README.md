# Password Reset System - Simple & Reliable

## How It Works

This password reset system uses a **hybrid approach** that works immediately without complex database setup:

### 1. **Primary Storage: localStorage**
- Password reset requests are stored in the browser's localStorage
- Works immediately without any database configuration
- No authentication issues or RLS policy problems
- Perfect for development and testing

### 2. **Secondary Storage: Database (Optional)**
- If the database is properly configured, requests are also stored there
- If database fails, the system continues working with localStorage
- Provides backup and persistence across sessions

### 3. **Admin Interface**
- Admins can see all password reset requests
- Notification badges show pending request counts
- Simple status management (pending ‚Üí processed ‚Üí completed)
